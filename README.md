General information on the R users Group at The University of Manchester. 


The R at University of Manchester Group exists to bring together R users of all levels, with interests in diverse fields from across the University to exchange tips, ideas and knowledge for the benefit of all. This group was previously known as the FLS R Group, and is inclusive to all Faculties of The University of Manchester.
